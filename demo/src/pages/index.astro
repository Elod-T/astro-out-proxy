<BaseLayout>
  <h1>🧑‍🚀 Hello, Astronaut!</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to the official <a href="">astro-out-proxy</a> website
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a normal internal link:
    <a href="/about">about</a> and works as expected.
  </p>

  <p>
    This however is an external link: <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> and
    it redirects to the out proxy.
  </p>
