  <h1>🧑‍🚀 Hello, Astronaut!</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to the official <a href="https://github.com/Elod-T/astro-out-proxy"
      >astro-out-proxy</a
    > website
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a normal internal link:
    <a href="/about">about</a> and works as expected.
  </p>

  <p>
    This however is an external link: <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>
    and it redirects to the out proxy.
  </p>

  <p>
    And altought this is an external link: <a
      href="https://astro.build"
      data-safe>Astro</a
    > it has the <code>data-safe</code> attribute and it will not redirect to the
    proxy and work as expected.
  </p>
</BaseLayout>
